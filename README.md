# Crimes in Russia from 2003 to 2020 analysis
### In this project I'll work with a dataset cointaining crimes committed in Russia from 2003 to 2020. The data is provided per month and it is sorted into multiple columns with different types of crime.
The repository contains the dataset (crime.csv), a jupyter notebook with the project (python_project_dataset_analysis.ipynb) and a streamlit web format of it (app.py).
